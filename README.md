# Audio Exploration 

In this mini-project, I am playing around with semantic audio chunking and data analysis techniques for TTS and STT. 

Here are a list of thing I intend to do: 
- [x] Build a pipeline to download videos and extract audio
- [x] Find a way to convert the audio to a text transcript
- [ ] Implement alignment of audio with text transcript
- [ ] Semantically chuck the aligned audio/transcript into >15s of audio-transcript pairs
- [ ] Apply techniques to get better transcript quaility (i.e. noise reduction)
- [ ] Achieve sematic richness of text segments as best as possible
- [ ] Aim for high timestamp accuracy without compromising any audio with the segment
